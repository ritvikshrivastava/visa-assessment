# Documentation

### Design
* The API ``visa_assessment/api.py`` receives as input a CV file and assesses the text within the file against
the eligibility criteria present in ``visa_assessment/eligibility.py`` using OpenAI's GPT-4o model.

* The model is prompted to check against all levels of evidence in our static eligibility document.

* Using the eligibility document as a resource, the model parses the text of the resume 
and finds corresponding matches to each criterion/eligibility category.  This code can be found in `visa_assessment/judge.py``

* Once this list is collected, a rating is generated based on the assumptions described later.

* Testing and validation of the responses was performed, and details are at the end of this document.
* Sample code to run the example is in the README.


### API response
API response is a JSON response with 
* "eligibility criterion" as the key corresponding the the criteria matching the requirements from the CV
* "rating": chances of eligibility

### Assumptions
* CV files can be of two types of inputs: PDFs, or text files 
* Categorization: High means atleast 5 criteria being met by evidence in CV, 3-4 means Medium, and the rest give a rating of low.
* Modeling: 
  * For the sake of experimentation using APIs and to cover for the lack of local GPU access to efficiently run open-source models, this project uses GPT-4o as the model of choice to leverage the LLM capabilities. I implemented this using Azure Open AI, but added additional code for it to be run using OpenAI directly. 
  * This can be replaced by any other proprietary model, say Claude/Gemini or any open source model say Llama3 or Mistral7b-instruct if resources are available.
  * A temperature of 0 was chosen as a strict measure to prevent hallucination or creativity and sticking to responses within the text.
  * The model token limit for responses was set to 1024.
* Criteria has been collected from the USCIS sources.
  * This data was then summarized in one-pass using a zero-shot GPT-4o run. This criteria was then stored as a dynamic evidence checking resource in ``visa_assessments/eligiblity.py``
  * This static data source is broken into two pieces per category of eligibility: description, and evidence types.

### Testing & Evaluation
* The ``tests/`` directory covers unittests to check for correctness
* The system has ``black`` and ``isort`` installed with poetry to clean-up the code.
* There is a test file included with Albert Einstein's synthetically generated resume in ``test_cv.txt``
* Following instructions to run the code in ``README.md``, the following response is generated by the API:
